This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Assumptions

Utilized API endpoints and assumed each aircraft had the same amount and type of flights, since mimicing just one aircraft.

## Getting Started

First, cd -> npm -> run dev:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
